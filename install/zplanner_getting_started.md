Getting Started with `zplanner`
===============

Getting Started
---------------

This is the zPlanner Quick Start page. Here you will find a minimal amount of information on how to get zPlanner running.

`zPlanner` uses VMware PowerCLI to gather information about your virtual machines from vCenter. All of the PowerCLI cmdlets used by zPlanner require read-only access to vCenter and all virtual machines under that vCenter (including those in folders, resource groups, etc).
