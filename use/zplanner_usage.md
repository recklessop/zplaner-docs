Using zPlanner
====================

Introduction
----------------
This document will explain how to use the zPlanner web UI to monitor virtual machines, look at stats on the predefined dashboards, as well as how to create your own dashboard.

### What zPlanner can do

The aim of zPlanner is to analyze storage metrics and deliver information to make a replication project successful. When planning a SAN upgrade, a disaster recovery project, or even a backup project, one of the questions you are generally asked is "What is your daily change rate." Most people will say they aren't sure, so just assume 10% daily change.

Sometimes that is close, other times it's way off. zPlanner aims to give you an exact number in terms of MB/s change rate, as well as help you determine how large of a WAN connection you would need.

Specific to Zerto, it will also help you determine how many Zerto Cloud Appliances you will need and even help you see how big your journal will be.
