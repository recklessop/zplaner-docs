Exporting zPlanner Stats Database
====================

Introduction
----------------
MySQL is used to store all stats data in zPlanner, by backing up the stats stats database you can deploy a new zPlanner later and recover old stats data. You can also exporte the database and send it to someone else who can then restore it on to a new zPlanner VM to view it.
