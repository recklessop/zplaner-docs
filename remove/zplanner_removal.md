What to do when you're done with zPlanner
---------------------

### Removal is easy!
zPlanner is 100% contained in a single virtual machine. To remove zPlanner, shutdown the zPlanner virtual machine and then delete it. 

This will remove all traces of zPlanner from your environment. Please note that it will also remove all of the data that was generated during the monitoring window.
