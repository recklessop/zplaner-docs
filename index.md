### Simple version
zPlanner is written and maintained by me, not Zerto. zPlanner uses read-only access to your vCenter server and has been rigorously tested to make sure it won’t hurt anything. However, use it at your own risk. I take no responsibility if you hurt your environment with it.

Feel free to view all of the code that zPlanner uses on it's [Github repo](http://github.com/Zerto-TA-Public/zPlanner) and decide for yourself if it’s safe to use.
